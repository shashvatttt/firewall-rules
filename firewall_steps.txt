Task: Configure and Test Basic Firewall Rules

1. Checked if UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) was installed:
   Command: sudo ufw status
   Output: "command not found" â†’ UFW was not installed.

2. Installed UFW on macOS (Note: UFW is not natively supported, so switched to pfctl for macOS firewall management).

3. Checked macOS firewall status:
   Command: sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate
   Output: Firewall is enabled.

4. Listed current firewall rules:
   Command: sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --listapps

5. Added a block rule for Telnet (port 23) [Demonstration purpose]:
   Command (example for Linux): sudo ufw deny 23
   On macOS, used pfctl config file to block inbound port 23.

6. Tested blocked port using:
   Command: nc -vz localhost 23
   Output: Connection refused (as expected).

7. Allowed SSH (port 22) [example for Linux]:
   Command: sudo ufw allow 22
   On macOS, allowed SSH via firewall settings.

8. Removed the test block rule for port 23:
   Command: sudo ufw delete deny 23
   On macOS, removed pfctl rule.

9. Summary:
   - Verified firewall is active.
   - Learned to block and allow specific ports.
   - Understood how firewall filters inbound traffic.
